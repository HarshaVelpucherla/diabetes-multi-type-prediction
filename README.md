# Multi-Type Diabetes Prediction

This project aims to create a machine learning model capable of predicting subtypes of diabetes, which can aid in early detection and potentially reduce the risk of disease progression.





## Research Objectives

- Training Machine Learning Models: Develop machine learning methods for predicting various types of diabetes.
- Evaluating Algorithm Performance: Measure the accuracy and reliability of the chosen algorithm(s).
- Identifying Past Limitations: Recognize the limitations in previous attempts to diagnose diabetes subtypes using machine learning techniques.
- Developing a Diagnostic Tool: Create a model that aids in early diagnosis of diabetes subtypes, potentially lowering the risk for individuals.

## Project Workflow

The project follows a structured workflow to ensure accurate results:

    1. Importing Modules and Loading the Dataset: Load all necessary libraries and the dataset required for analysis.
    2. Data Analysis and Visualization: Explore the dataset and visualize key features to understand its characteristics.
    3. Model Training: Train machine learning models on the dataset.
    4. Model Evaluation: Evaluate the modelâ€™s performance using appropriate metrics.
    5. Model Testing: Test the model on new data to assess its predictive power.

## Software and Modules

* Text Editor: Google Colaboratory
* Programming Language and Modules:
    * NumPy: For numerical data operations.
    * Pandas: For data manipulation and handling.
    * Scikit-learn: For machine learning model training and evaluation.
    * Matplotlib: For data visualization.
    * Seaborn: For enhanced data visualization.

## Conclusion and Future Scope
* This model successfully predicts diabetes subtypes. By applying the Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm on both Type-1 and Type-2 diabetes datasets, we achieved an accuracy of:
    * Type-1 Diabetes: 100%
    * Type-2 Diabetes: 85%
Future work may involve improving model accuracy further, expanding to additional subtypes of diabetes, or integrating additional datasets to enhance model generalizability.
